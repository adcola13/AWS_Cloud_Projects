    "# Get Started with Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Like all artificial intelligence, generative AI is powered by machine learning modelsâ€”very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to as foundation models (FMs). Apart from content creation, generative AI is also used to improve the quality of digital images, edit video, build prototypes quickly for manufacturing, augment data with synthetic datasets, and more.\n",

We show several example prompt engineering use cases, including code generation, question answering, and controlled model output.\n",

For details on the specific DeepSeek model version, training data, and potential limitations (such as language support or inherent biases), refer to the model's documentation or the SageMaker JumpStart page used for its deployment.\n",

    "\n",
    "DeepSeek models deployed through SageMaker AI often accept parameters within a JSON payload. The exact parameters depend on the specific deployment container (for example, TGI, vLLM, and DJL). Based on the reference code, a common structure for chat/instruct models involves a `messages` list and other generation controls. Common parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **messages:** A list of message objects, each with `role` ('user', 'assistant', or sometimes 'system') and `content` (the text of the message). This allows for conversational context.\n",
    "* **max_tokens** (or `max_new_tokens`): Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls randomness. Lower values (0.1-0.3) make the output more focused and deterministic; higher values (0.7-1.0) make it more creative and diverse.\n",
    "* **top_p:** Nucleus sampling parameter. Considers only the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `top_p`.\n",
    "* **stop:** A list of strings. Generation stops if the model produces any of these strings.\n",

    "Refer to the documentation of your specific SageMaker AI deployment (for example, TGI container images or the SageMaker JumpStart model card) for the definitive list of supported parameters and payload structure."

    "## Use clear and specific instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering techniquesâ€”such as zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot approachesâ€”offer different ways to guide AI models to produce desired outputs. Zero-shot prompting is the most basic approach, where you directly ask the model to perform a task without examples. Zero-shot prompting is useful for straightforward requests, but it might lack precision for complex tasks. One-shot prompting provides a single example along with the request, which helps the model understand the expected format and style of the response. Few-shot prompting takes this further by providing multiple examples, which is particularly effective for complex tasks that require pattern recognition or specific output structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear instructions are crucial across all these techniques because they reduce ambiguity and help the model understand exactly what's expected. When instructions are specific, well-structured, and include details about the desired format, context, and constraints, the model is more likely to generate accurate and relevant responses. For example, instead of asking the model to \"generate some code,\" a clear instruction might specify that the model should \"write a Python function that handles errors, includes logging, and returns JSON responses with specific fields.\"\n"

A lower temperature (closer to 0) makes responses more deterministic and focused, which is better for factual or technical tasks where accuracy is crucial.
