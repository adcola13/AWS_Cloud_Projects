Deploying Foundation Models with Amazon SageMaker AI

Project successfully deployed foundation models using Amazon SageMaker AI—leveraging JumpStart and Studio to bring cutting-edge generative AI capabilities into seamless production.

Key Highlights:
* Configured and launched SageMaker Studio environments for streamlined model deployment and experimentation.
* Deployed foundation models (e.g., DeepSeek‑R1 variants) via SageMaker JumpStart, setting up real-time inference endpoints using the SageMaker Python SDK.
* Implemented prompt experimentation—zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, plus chain-of-thought techniques—to refine and enhance generative responses.
* Tuned output behavior using parameters like temperature to balance creativity and accuracy.
* Utilized fast-launch Studio notebooks with persistent storage to collaborate efficiently.
* Completed endpoint lifecycle management—from setup to inference testing and cleanup.

This project not only underscores the power and flexibility of Amazon SageMaker AI but also highlights the impact of applying prompt engineering strategies for high-quality model outputs.
